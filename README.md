# JKMBot

Howdy! This is the GitHub repo for JKMBot! Welcome! 

This bot was designed for translating Japanese to English, and vice versa, with respect to vocabulary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and missionary work. 

## Commands
    /help
  brings up a help menu

    /no
  sends a message without translating it

## Editing the Dictionary
If for some reason you need to add new terms to the dictionary, edit the file called "app.py" and add terms to the dictionary following the same format as the other terms! It should look like this:

    '[key]': '[definition]',
    '[english]': '[japanese]'
  
depending on which dictionary you are adding to! There are two dictionaries, one for English -> Japanese, and one for Japanese -> English! You can edit the code either in a code editor, or within GitHub itself! (It might be easier to do it within GitHub if you don't know anything about VSCode or coding in general)
